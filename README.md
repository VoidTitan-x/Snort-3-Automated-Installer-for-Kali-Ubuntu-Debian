# Snort-3-Automated-Installer-for-Kali-Ubuntu-Debian
This repository provides a robust Bash script to build and install Snort 3 from source on modern Kali, Ubuntu, and Debian systems. It handles all required dependencies, resolves common package naming issues, builds LibDAQ with proper libpcap support, and makes DAQ module discovery persistent so the plain snort command works without extra flags.
